1) Imagine you are implementing string.h from scratch ( which means basically if you want to use string functions,
you have to implement them).
void strrev( char *str );
Implement this function, using pointers.

2) Write a program that takes a 2D array of strings, and sorts them alphabetically. Use pointers, and you will see how
pointers make it effortless to do such actions.

3) Write a function that does matrix multiplication. The catch is you are only allowed to pass in pointers.
