BIT MANIPULATION:
-------------------------------------

1) Count the number of ones in the binary represenation of an integer (An O(n) solution is fine, where n is the number of bits used to
represent the number, but as a part of this question atleast google and find out what the O(m) solution is, where m is the number of ones
in the binary representation).

2) a) Check if the 13th bit of a number is set, and if it is, clear the 8th bit of the number.
b) Figure out a way to perform this operation without using conditional expressions or the ternary operator.

3) Swap the adjacent bits of an integer. For example, swap the first and second bits, the third and fourth bits and so on.
